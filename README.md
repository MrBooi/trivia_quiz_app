# Opentrivia

I've been reading about riverpod on Twitter, so this project is a way for me to learn riverpod and explore some of the most powerful features and problems riverpod solve. 

### what to expect

- Unit Testing
- Widget Testing
- integration Testing

### First-Time Setup



```
git clone https://github.com/MrBooi/trivia_quiz_app
make flutter_build_runner

```

### Running the test
Simply run `make_futter_test` to run both the unit and widget test



To explore the test coverage, run tests with following commands
```
make flutter_coverage
```
Then generate coverage files
```
make flutter_coverage_files
```
Then open the html files:
```
make flutter_open_coverage_html
```
