# Opentrivia

I've been reading about riverpod on Twitter, so this project is a way for me to learn riverpod and explore some of the most powerful features and problems riverpod solve. 

### what to expect

- Unit Testing
- Widget Testing
- integration Testing

### First-Time Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/MrBooi/trivia_quiz_app
make flutter_build_runner
```
### Running the tests
 Use the following command to run both widget and unit tests

```
make flutter_test
```

To explore the test coverage, run tests with following commands
```
make flutter_coverage
```
Then generate coverage files
```
make flutter_coverage_files
```
Then open the html files:
```
make flutter_open_coverage_html
```
